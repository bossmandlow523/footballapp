# Dynamic Playbook Integration - Feature Design Brief

## Feature Overview

**Priority**: P0 (Critical for MVP)

**User Story**: "As a coach, I want to upload my existing playbook and have it automatically organized and personalized for each player, so that I can focus on coaching instead of creating study materials."

**Success Criteria**:
- 90%+ accuracy in automatic play categorization and tagging
- Position-specific assignment highlighting with personalized explanations
- Mobile-optimized viewing with intuitive navigation and offline access
- Seamless integration with signal management and learning systems

## User Experience Analysis

### Primary User Goal
Transform static PDF playbooks into dynamic, interactive learning tools that provide each player with personalized, position-specific instruction and seamless integration with team signals and practice routines.

### Success Criteria
- **Upload Simplicity**: Coaches can upload and process entire playbooks in under 5 minutes
- **AI Accuracy**: 90%+ correct automatic categorization of plays by formation, personnel, and situation
- **Personalization**: Each player sees only relevant information with their specific assignments highlighted
- **Mobile Optimization**: Playbook content perfectly readable and navigable on mobile devices
- **Offline Access**: Complete playbook available without internet connection

### Key Pain Points Addressed
1. **Static Playbooks**: PDF playbooks provide no interactivity or personalization
2. **Information Overload**: Players overwhelmed by entire playbook instead of position-specific content
3. **Study Inefficiency**: Players struggle to find relevant plays and understand assignments
4. **Coach Workload**: Coaches spend hours creating position-specific study materials manually
5. **Mobile Limitations**: Traditional playbooks not optimized for mobile study sessions

### Navigation Structure
**Primary Navigation**: All Plays → My Position → Favorites → Search
**Secondary Navigation**: Formation filters, down & distance, personnel packages
**Contextual Navigation**: Related plays, signal connections, video breakdowns

### Mental Model Alignment
Players think in terms of **their job first**, then the overall play. The interface prioritizes:
1. **Position Assignment** (What do I do?)
2. **Formation Recognition** (What does this look like?)
3. **Situational Context** (When do we run this?)
4. **Team Coordination** (How does everyone else fit?)

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy
- **Level 1**: Player's primary assignment with key coaching points
- **Level 2**: Formation overview with player positioning
- **Level 3**: Full team assignments and coordination details
- **Level 4**: Advanced reads, adjustments, and alternative options
