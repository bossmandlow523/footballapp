# FootballIQ Design System - Project Overview

## Platform Summary
FootballIQ is an AI-powered football education platform that transforms static playbooks and confusing signals into personalized, interactive learning experiences. Designed specifically for high school football coaches and players aged 14-18, the platform eliminates signal confusion and accelerates player development through intelligent automation.

## Design Philosophy
Our design embodies **bold simplicity** with **mobile-first architecture**, creating frictionless experiences that prioritize user objectives over decorative elements. Every interface element serves the ultimate goal of making complex football concepts effortlessly understandable for teenage athletes and time-pressed coaches.

## Core Design Principles
- **Football-First UX**: Every design decision optimized for football education workflows
- **Mobile-Primary**: 80%+ usage on mobile devices during practice and study
- **Cognitive Load Optimization**: Complex playbook concepts simplified through strategic information hierarchy
- **Performance-Driven**: Sub-3-second load times critical for sideline usage
- **Accessibility-Native**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive educational access
